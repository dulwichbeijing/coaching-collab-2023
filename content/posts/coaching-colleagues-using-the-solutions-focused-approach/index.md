## What is the Solution Focused Approach?

Brief UK define The Solution Focused Approach as follows:

> The Solution Focused approach was developed in America in the 1980s by Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg. After spending many years studying problem behaviour and trying to change it they switched to studying 'solution behaviour' and how to promote it! Two simple ideas lie at the bottom of solution focus.
> Nobody is perfect and this applies to our problems as well as everything else. If no-one can 'do' their problem perfectly there must always be times when they don't do them so well. These times de Shazer and Berg called exceptions. Whatever the person is doing differently at these 'exceptional' times will be the basis of a potential solution. Part of the solution focused practitioner's task is therefore to discover whatever a person is already doing which might contribute to the resolution of the problem with which they have come.
> The second simple idea is that knowing where you want to get to makes the getting there much more likely. One of the common consequences of a serious problem is that it clouds our view of the future. We know that we don't want the problem but we have lost sight of what it is we do want. Solution focused practitioners ask lots of questions about what life might be like if the problem was solved. As the answers to these questions gradually unfold both practitioner and client begin to get a picture of where they should be heading. The clearer this becomes the greater the possibility of it beginning to happen.

These two ideas together make up solution focused brief therapy which widespread research shows to be effective in 65-83% of cases in an average of 4-5 sessions.

[You can find out more about the approach and its applications on the Brief UK website](https://www.brief.org.uk/therapy-and-coaching/what-happens-in-solution-focused-therapy). It is now widely used in settings other than counselling including coaching, team building and in schools:

## Case Study

In 2021 I moved from my pastoral role as Head of Year 13 to working as Head of English, an academic role. It was during the covid pandemic when everyone was struggling, staff and students. I realised that I could use the Solution Focused Approach that I had been using with students in a pastoral setting, to help support my team of English teachers too.

It is important to note that I am not a trained counsellor and it was not my role to counsel members of my team through tough times. However, many of my team were struggling with workload and stress after the pressures created by Covid. I am currently trained in Level 2 Solution Focused Practice (Brief UK). It was reassuring to learn from the Solution Focused courses I attended at Brief UK that I could not do any harm by using this method (say for example if someone is seeking support from a trained counsellor outside of school) and Solution Focused practice works well alongside other forms of support people may be seeking. Brief had a number of resources adapted for use with managing teams in a wide variety of settings and I found the book Team Talk particularly helpful as a first step towards applying Solution Focused to this new middle leadership role (see the link below to the book). I wanted to empower my new team through careful questioning and provide more opportunities for them to describe a desired future.

First step, was to begin the year well and set a positive tone for the future. The team had also experienced remote working and needed to get back into the habit of working more collaboratively again. I wanted to begin the new academic year well and help us all to begin moving on. Previous meetings had become bogged down with us talking about issues and it felt like little was being done to improve things. We were in survival mode. The goal was to create a team who felt more in control of their vision and direction, who could move forward and make positive changes, post pandemic. I started planning my first department meeting and looking for a way structure the meeting so that people would feel heard, but so we could also move beyond our problems. Here is a link to a podcast by consultant Matt Ayton that I found very helpful at this time. It gave me a suggested meeting structure that I used for our first goal setting meeting of the year.

## Reflection

I found the meeting structure very successful. It gave me confidence to keep us all on track and frame the discussions more positively. It helped us to build a development plan that was truly collaborative. Staff were much more inclined to take responsibility for implementing changes on that plan and the four goals we created that guided the plan were useful in meetings throughout the rest of the year. They kept us all on track and helped us during times of disagreement too.

## Next Steps and Resources

After establishing a clear vision and development plan, relationships in the team and working practices became more comfortable and productive again. However, in the following year, covid continued to unsettle us and there was still a need for 121 support, particularly with a team who had felt quite isolated in further covid lockdowns. We also had a number of new staff who needed support settling in. Again I looked to Solution Focus to help me structure those 121 meetings. I also found the Amazing If website and the Squiggly Careers podcast very useful for building my confidence when taking a coaching approach to supporting my team.
I decided to send emails to staff who had a 121 meeting coming up and ask them to set the agenda. I created a template for this (see link below) which helped to make the most of the time we had together and structure the discussion. I also used the Values Compass mentioned in the Squiggly Careers podsheet (How to improve our 121s). This gave us something to focus our discussion on and prevented the conversation from just being about jobs or procedures at work. After the 121 meetings, I realised that it was important to also request feedback on how they had found our conversation, so I could also develop my coaching skills. This openness to feedback has also strengthened our team relationships and helped to embed the coaching culture into our team. I then began using this follow up feedback form (see link below) and emailing it to staff who I had done a 121 with me. This was a great conversation starter for our next meeting and helped me to model how I was also reflecting on my own growth and development as part of this process.

I will continue to use the Solution Focused approach and hope that others find these resources useful when working either with a group of colleagues together or on a 121 basis.
