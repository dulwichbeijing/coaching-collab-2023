As technology continues to advance, so too does its integration into classrooms around the world. Learning technology tools have the potential to revolutionize the way students learn, engage with material, and connect with each other. However, simply dropping technology into the classroom is not enough. As a technology integrators, it is our responsibility to ensure that teachers are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively utilize these tools to enhance student learning.

Coaching teachers to use edtech tools in their classroom not only requires a deep understanding of how these technologies work but also a good levels of trust between the coach and the colleague being supported. Educators must trust their coaches and feel comfortable expressing their concerns and asking questions. Moreover, different teachers will have varying levels of comfort with technology. A one-size-fits-all approach to edtech coaching simply won't work. Instead, coaches must take the time to get to know their teachers' individual needs, the needs of their students before coming up with a plan of action.

## Case Study

This year at DCB, one of the members of staff I've been working with is a member of the Senior School English Department who wanted to better embed technology within her practice.

We identified an area of tech integration we could focus on with her Y8 EAL lessons with the aim of **using technology to encourage students to communicating with a wider range of students during class**.

After introducing some gamified elements into the classroom through technology, we hoped to foster a more collaborative environment where students feel more and more comfortable talking to each other. We started by introducing Quizlet Live as an end of lesson reflection tool to move students into random groups and encourage them to regularly work with new people as part of their themes and vocabulary review for the book *Naughts and Crosses*.

When asking for feedback from my coachee, she commented that she appreciated that I took the time to learn about her class, the needs of the students and the issues she’s been having. From there, we were able to co-construct a goal by marrying my knowledge of technology platforms with her subject knowledge to improve the learning experience for her students.

## Reflection

After observing my coachee's lesson and performing the post-observation coaching interview, we had a very fruitful conversation about the amount of value the new technology tool added to the class.

When observing a lesson, I felt that there was still much to do in terms of fostering student collaboration, but I was assured that it was night and day compared to the class' normal daily interactions. 

> It was great to actually see the boys talking to the girls, they didn’t make it obvious but you could tell they were really enjoying the games!

When discussing what strategies we could employ to further develop their communication skills using tech, we agreed on strategies based around using the same tech platforms but organising the students differently within the room so they could not use each other’s devices during the game. This (hopefully) will ensure that they chat with each other rather than simply reaching over and using each other’s devices in the pursuit of the fasting possible finishing time.
