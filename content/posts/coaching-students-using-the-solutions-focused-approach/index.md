## What is the Solution Focused Approach?

Brief UK define The Solution Focused Approach as follows:

> The Solution Focused approach was developed in America in the 1980s by Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg. After spending many years studying problem behaviour and trying to change it they switched to studying 'solution behaviour' and how to promote it! Two simple ideas lie at the bottom of solution focus.
> Nobody is perfect and this applies to our problems as well as everything else. If no-one can 'do' their problem perfectly there must always be times when they don't do them so well. These times de Shazer and Berg called exceptions. Whatever the person is doing differently at these 'exceptional' times will be the basis of a potential solution. Part of the solution focused practitioner's task is therefore to discover whatever a person is already doing which might contribute to the resolution of the problem with which they have come.
> The second simple idea is that knowing where you want to get to makes the getting there much more likely. One of the common consequences of a serious problem is that it clouds our view of the future. We know that we don't want the problem but we have lost sight of what it is we do want. Solution focused practitioners ask lots of questions about what life might be like if the problem was solved. As the answers to these questions gradually unfold both practitioner and client begin to get a picture of where they should be heading. The clearer this becomes the greater the possibility of it beginning to happen.

These two ideas together make up solution focused brief therapy which widespread research shows to be effective in 65-83% of cases in an average of 4-5 sessions.

[You can find out more about the approach and it’s applications on the Brief UK website](https://www.brief.org.uk/therapy-and-coaching/what-happens-in-solution-focused-therapy). It is now widely used in settings other than counselling, including coaching, team building and in schools.

## A Case Study

In September 2022 I was asked to coach a student in Year 12 who was struggling with organisation and time management in all their subjects. This student also had an IEP and had some learning needs which was making it hard for them to deal with the time management side of the IB course. I was asked to act as an academic coach for the student with the aim of finding strategies for the student to help them manage their stress and workload better. The Solution Focused Approach seemed perfect here as we wanted to empower this student to find her own solutions that worked for her both in IB and long term. This student was also working with a professional counsellor for pastoral concerns. It is important to note that I am not a trained counsellor and it was not my role to counsel this student or diagnose mental health concerns. However, Solution Focus works very well when coaching young people in these circumstances. I am currently trained in Level 2 Solution Focused Practice (Brief UK). It was reassuring to learn from the Solution Focused courses I attended at Brief UK that I could not do any harm by using this method (say for example if someone is seeking support from a trained clinical counsellor outside of school) and Solution Focused practice works well alongside other forms of counselling as the focus is not talking about the ‘problem’. Brief had a number of resources adapted for use within schools. 

Brief recommend the following texts for using Solution Focused Practice in schools:

- Mahlberg, Kerstin and Sjoblom, Maud (2004) Solution Focused Education
- James, Geoffrey (2016) Transforming Behaviour in the Classroom: A solution-focused guide for new teachers. London: Sage.
- Focused Brief Therapy in Alternative Schools: Ensuring student success and preventing dropout. London: Routledge.
- Durrant, Michael (1995) Creative Strategies for School Problems. New York: Norton.

The Level 1 and Level 2 courses I attended at Brief and my reading helped me to develop the following meeting structures for first meetings and follow up meetings:

- [Solution Focused sessions with students first session](docs/Solution%20Focused%20Student%20Coaching%20Session%201.docx)
- [Solution Focused sessions with students second session](docs/Solution%20Focused%20Student%20Coaching%20Session%202.docx)

## Reflection

The sessions were very effective and we saw a significant improvement in the student’s ability to manage her time across all their subjects.

Following our first two sessions above it became clear that the student wanted two things:

1. More confidence in communicating with staff and asking for help
2. Tools to help with to do lists, so they were sustainable and didn’t become overwhelming

The discussion of point 1, lead to a practical session where we began ‘scripting’ conversations and emails together that needed to happen with members of staff. We rehearsed and role played these. This helped to create an imagined future where the student could visual and walk through the solution. In follow up meetings, we then discussed what the student noticed when they tried these scripts in ‘real life’.

- [Student script asking for support from staff](docs/An%20example%20of%20helping%20a%20student%20to%20script%20-%20conversations%20about%20extra%20time%20coaching.docx)

The discussion of point 2, lead to more practical sessions where we experimented with organisational tools and different types of to do lists. We found these websites and articles useful and we both experimented together with different approaches and Apps and then reflected on our findings in the following session: 

- [I tried 4 to-do list methods, here's what worked](https://hbr.org/2021/01/i-tried-4-to-do-list-methods-heres-what-worked)
- [To do list strategies](docs/To%20do%20list%20strategies%20to%20experiment%20with.docx)

As a result of these coaching sessions the student went into their midcourse exams calm and well prepared. The results showed a significant improvement for this student, compared to term 1 results.

After the midcourse exams, the student had done well and fell out of the habit of seeing me on a regular basis (because things were going well). A few weeks later though, something happened outside school that unsettled this student and we began to see signs of struggle once more; I reached out via email, but decided to initiate this discussion with a request for feedback on me this time and our previous sessions in the year. My openness to feedback strengthened our coaching relationship again and kick started some follow up meetings which were effective at getting the student back on track. The feedback form attached was a great conversation starter for our follow up meetings and helped me to model how I was also reflecting on my own growth and development as part of this coaching process.

## Next Steps and Resources 

I have used these resources with other students now and I find it gives me the confidence and a reliable framework to fall back on in a busy working day. It also gives me a place to record notes to share with other members of staff should I need to. It makes the process transparent to other members of staff and makes my role as coach clear. I am not a counsellor so confidentiality cannot be promised with students. This allows me to liaise well with colleagues responsible for pastoral concerns or academic performance as I have a good record of what is happening and a clear structure for the support I can offer which protects us all from a safeguarding perspective.
